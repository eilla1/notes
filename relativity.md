## Modern Physics
- Two important theories
	- _relativity_ (special and general): describes the very big and fast
	- _quantum mechanics_: describes the very small like atoms and shit
- Relativity and QM are currently incompatible
- The goal: unite the two in a **Grand Unified Theory**
- one possibility => quantum theory of gravity

## Special Relativity
- Time is affected by motion at constant velocity
- _inertial reference frame_ = nonaccelerating
- Space and time exist within the universe
- Relativity shows that we move through _space-time_
- Standing still => traveling through time at a max. rate
- Traveling at the fastest velocity possible (speed of light) => time stands still
- Motion is relative to one's intertial reference frame

## The First Postulate
- _The laws of nature are the same in all inertial reference frames_
- No experiement can determine if an object is at rest or moving with constant _v_

## The Second Postulate
- _The speed of light in vacuum is constant in all intertial reference frames._
 $$c = 3.000 * 10^8 m/s$$
 $$\frac{space}{time} = \frac{SPACE}{TIME} = c$$

## Time Dilation
- Example: clock and spaceship experiment
- Light Clock
	- Light bounces between parallel mirrors at equal time intervals
	- Light clock in different reference frames is perceived differently
- _Time dilation_ - a stretching of time at relativistic speeds
$$ (ct)^2 = (ct_0)^2 + (vt)^2$$
$$ t = \frac{t_0}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v^2}{c^2})}}$$

$$t > t_0 (always)$$
- $t$ is the dilated time (your perspective on earth)
- $t_0$ is the proper time (perceived by the person traveling at the speed)

- Twin Paradox: travelling twin (at the speed of light) does not age as fast as stationery twin
- Moving at relativistic speeds, it is possible to time travel to the future
- We can see into the past but not go there

## Conclusions
- Time flows at different rates for observers in different inertial frames of reference
